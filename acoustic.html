        <h3>Using grid format</h3>

        <p class="acoustic_p">An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the guitar family, that projects the sounds of its vibrating strings acoustically through the air. 
            Originally just called a guitar, the retronym 'acoustic guitar' came in use to distinguish it from an electric guitar, that relies on an electronic amplification system.
             The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the instrument's body, amplifying the sound. Typically, a guitar's body is a sound box,
              of which the top side serves as a sound board that enhances the vibration sounds of the strings. In standard tuning the guitar's six strings 
              are tuned (low to high) E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.</p>

            <p>An acoustic-electric guitar is an acoustic guitar fitted with a magnetic pickup, a piezoelectric pickup, or a microphone. They are also referred to as a "plug-in acoustic guitar", 
                for being able to simply "plug in" to a sound board without the need for microphones. They are used in a variety of music genres, where the sound of an acoustic
                guitar is desired but more volume is required, especially during live performances. The design is distinct from a semi-acoustic guitar, which is an electric guitar with the
                addition of sound chambers within the guitar body.

                Usually, acoustic-electric guitars are fitted with piezoelectric pickups, requiring a preamplifier incorporated into the guitar body to amplify the signal before it travels to the
                main guitar amplifier. These preamps may also come with tone controls of varying types; equalizers with up to six frequency bands may be used.</p>

                <p class="childs">Abasi Larada guitars give visionary players the creative tools to break boundaries. Guitarists who seek to explore new realms of sound, 
                    responsiveness or ergonomics will discover exceptional sonic depth and playability. 6-string and 8-string models are available for order now,

                <p class="childs">The Ibanez RG7 CST was a very limited run of top quality 7-string guitars. There were only 18 of these made in 1999. Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit played one.

                    7CST was produced in 2 series under names RG7-PB1VV and RG7-PB2VV. RG7-PB1VV was a pilot proto run and RG7-PB2VV was made in May 1999.</p>

                <p class="childs">Perry Ormsby started his working life as a carpenter, however fine woodworking was what he gravitated towards. He transferred across to a cabinet making apprenticeship 
                    and finished his time achieving the highest marks recorded within his state’s history. An apprentice of the year nomination was offered, but the competition wasn’t for him. He just wanted to make ‘stuff’.

        <h1>ELECTRIC GUITARS</h1>

        <h3>Using float format</h3>

        <p id="intro_p">An electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals. 
            The vibration occurs when a guitar player strums, plucks, fingerpicks, slaps or taps the strings. The pickup generally uses electromagnetic induction 
            to create this signal, which being relatively weak is fed into a guitar amplifier before being sent to the speaker(s), which converts it into audible sound.

                The electric signal can be electronically altered to change the timbre of the sound. Often, the signal is modified using effects such as reverb, distortion 
                and "overdrive"; the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing.</p>

                <p>The Fender Stratocaster is a model of electric guitar designed from 1952 into 1954 by Leo Fender, 
                    Bill Carson, George Fullerton, and completed by Freddie Tavares. The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation 
                    has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster from 1954 to the present. It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top 
                    "horn" shape for balance like the Precision Bass guitar.
                <br>
                Original Stratocasters were manufactured with five vibrato springs (three in late 1953 prototypes) attached to a milled inertia block and anchored to 
                the back of the body. The novel mechanism pivots on a fulcrum design with a six screw bridge plate, allowing the whole set up to "float" while 
                transferring the strings energy directly into the body. Though advertised as "Tremolo" (a change in volume amplitude), vibrato is the correct term for pitch
                 variation. In the floating position, players can move the bridge-mounted vibrato tremolo arm up or down to modulate the pitch of the notes being played.

                <p>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952.The Les Paul
                     was designed by Gibson president Ted McCarty, factory manager John Huis and their team with some input from and endorsement by guitarist 
                     Les Paul. Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a
                      rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.</p>

                    <p>Paul Reed Smith set up a partnership to create a factory in Annapolis, Maryland and set off work on producing guitars.
                         The company's first outing was for the 1985 NAMM Show where they debuted the PRS Custom. Featuring a mahogany neck set into 
                         a mahogany body with a maple cap, a patented vibrato, customized tuning pegs, and custom rotary pickup switching with high quality 
                         electronics, the guitar represented influences from both old and new; something striking in the midst of an industry that was producing 
                         “high tech” guitars. “I saw Adrian Belew on King Crimson’s Beat tour in 1982,” says Smith, “and the sound he was getting out of his guitar 
                         was on another planet somewhere. </p>

                    <p>The Ibanez JEM is an electric guitar manufactured by Ibanez and first produced in 1987. The guitar's most notable user is its co-designer, 
                        Steve Vai. As of 2010, there have been five sub-models of the JEM: the JEM7, JEM77, JEM777, JEM555, JEM333, and JEM70V. Although the Ibanez 
                        JEM series is a signature series guitar, Ibanez mass-produces several of the guitar's sub-models.

                            The design of the Ibanez JEM series was heavily influenced by the superstrat style of guitars of the early 1980s such as the Jackson Soloist, 
                            Kramer Beretta and Hamer Chaparral. This type of guitar is more aggressively styled in terms of shape and specifications compared to the Stratocaster 
                            on which they are based.</p>
